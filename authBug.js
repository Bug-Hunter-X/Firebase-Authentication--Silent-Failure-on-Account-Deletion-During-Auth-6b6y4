The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's account is deleted or disabled after the authentication process starts but before it completes. This can happen if there's a network delay or if the backend updates the account status while the client is still trying to authenticate.  The resulting error message isn't always clear, making debugging difficult.  This can manifest as an unhandled promise rejection or a silent failure, depending on your error handling.
